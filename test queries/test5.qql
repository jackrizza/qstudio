-- This test is for the foundation of models
-- and functions


-- something to note. qql is not case sensitive but when developing
-- functions I found it easier to distiguious internal functions from 
-- built in functions
FUNC foo
    -- This is theory is the same as def foo(open) : in python
    TAKES open
    VAR output
    ADD open, 50 INTO output
    RETURN ouput

FRAME base
    HISTORICAL
    TICKER aapl
    FROM 20200101 TO 20250101
    PULL open, close, low, high
    -- Next is to add a function
    -- CALC is always used to call functions inside frames
    CALC open foo CALLED foo_open

MODEL base
    FORECAST open
